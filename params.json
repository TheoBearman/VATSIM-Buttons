{"name":"Vatsim-buttons","tagline":"Bootstap Buttons with VATSIM Data.","body":"# VATSIM Buttons\r\nThese are a set of Bootstrap buttons that display the current VATSIM METAR at some selected airfields as well as a button displaying the total number of users online on the network.\r\n\r\nThese buttons make use of [Vatsimphp](https://github.com/skymeyer/Vatsimphp) by [Skymeyer](https://github.com/skymeyer).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAssuming you have already installed Composer, CD to your VATSIM Buttons folder and run:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ composer require skymeyer/vatsimphp 1.0.*\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr add vatsimphp manually to your composer.json of your current project:\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n    \"require\": {\r\n        \"skymeyer/vatsimphp\": \"1.0.*\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, setup a cronjob to run the `vatcron.php` file every 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThis basic setup gives you buttons for METARs from a range of aerodromes. To add a button for a new airport, add this to your `index.php` file:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n<li><button style=\"height: 40px;\" \r\nclass=\"btn btn-primary getMetarButtons hvr-float-shadow\" data-location = \"***AERODROME ICAO HERE***\">\r\n***AERODROME NAME HERE***</button></li>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo add a button using data parsed from the `VATSIM Data file`, you will need to make a seperate `.php` file for that particular data set and then add a new script to the `index.php` file in order to run it. More details on how to do this can be found on the VatsimPHP project page [here](https://github.com/skymeyer/Vatsimphp).\r\n\r\n## Thanks to\r\n\r\n* Skymeyer\r\n* Anthony Lawrence\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
