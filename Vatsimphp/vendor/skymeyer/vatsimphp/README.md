=================

Vatsimphp collects and parses the publically available statistics
from the [VATSIM.net](http://www.vatsim.net) network. It provides
iterators for the available data and basic search/filtering
capabilities without using a database backend.

Vatsimphp uses an intelligent local file cache to avoid consuming
unnecessary bandwidth from the public data servers. The software
comes with sensible default settings, but can be changed if
required. Vatsimphp can be dropped into your crontab very easily
to avoid inline data updates in your web application.

A "cache only" node is available if another process
is already responsible to retrieve the raw data files from the
VATSIM network or if live connections are not applicable.

Vatsimphp can be easily plugged into existing PHP systems to
query VATSIM data or feed the parsed results into a database
backend of your choice.
